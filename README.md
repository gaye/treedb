treedb
======

JSON tree database for the web inspired by Firebase.

### Usage

Currently, TreeDB implements a subset of the Firebase [2.2.4 Javascript API](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/) in the browser. Internally, it uses [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) which is only implemented in modern browsers.
